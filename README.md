## Description:
Timber Frame is an HTML and CSS Framework for building simple wireframe presentations.

It uses Bower and Grunt to initialize and build css and js files, Jekyll as a templating/site build system, and Less as a preprocessor. Theres a good amount of Bootstrap mixins tossed in as well.

## Dependencies:
Jekyll
Bower
Grunt
Node

## ToDo:
- Build out section elements:
-- Slider
-- Accordion
-- Lorem Ipsum generated text
-- Custom Text with header
- Navigation for all templates (either via data file or loop files in templates)
